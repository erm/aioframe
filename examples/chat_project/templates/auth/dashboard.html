Hi {{ user.username }}<br>
<br>
Try joining a <a href="/chat/rooms/mychatroom/">chatroom</a>, the roomname can be anything. Nothing is currently stored.<br>
<br>
Try a <a href="/chat/bots/markov/test/">markov bot</a>. You just feed it a link to a textfile (just http:// links at the moment) and it will generate sentences based on it. Nothing is stored, but the data sourced will persist and can be accessed by others.<br>
